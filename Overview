While using NLTK we explored language processing by searching through the provided texts like Moby Dick. We searched for the number of times that the words monstrous and ship were used and the sentences it was used in. In addition we used codes to find how many words were in each text finding that Moby Dick had the most words out of all of the 9 texts.
